Tour Recommendation System
This is a smart and easy-to-use tour recommendation website for exploring tourist destinations across India. It suggests places based on user interests using content-based filtering. Users can view city details, explore top destinations, and browse by categories like beaches, historical places, and hill stations.

The project includes a user-friendly frontend built with React and a backend using Python (Flask) and Node.js/Express, with custom data for Indian cities.
